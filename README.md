# Tic-Tac-Toe-AiGame

**This game was a school project where the task was to create a program which runs tic tac toe using 4 different types of AI**

*TTTv1* - The first version of tic tac toe is a player vs player version, with no AI, so players can play against each other

*TTTv2* - The second version of the tic tac toe game includes an AI which places moves randomly, without any particular logic

*TTTv3* - The third version of the game includes an AI which uses a "killer move" when it is able to win or block a win, but places randomly otherwise

*TTTv4* - The fourth version of the game adds a board evaluator to the previous version, which evaluates each possible move and gives it a score depending on its outcome, and then chooses the move with the best score

*TTTv5* - The final version of the game has an AI which places according to the minimax backtracking algorithm

Along with the classes for the different versions of the tic tac toe game, there are also two other classes: the Board class which contains functions essential to the functionality of the board,
and the TTTGame class which operates the menu.

_*This is the command line version of this program. The GUI version will be coming soon (hopefully ðŸ¤ž)_
